# URL Monitor App

Welcome to the URL Monitor App! This simple application allows you to monitor the availability and response time of URLs. The main focus of this app is simplicity and ease of use. I've deliberately avoided complex and over-engineered solutions to keep things straightforward.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install the required dependencies** using `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can find the dummy file in the root directory of this repository.
4. **Run the app** using `npm start`.

## To-Do List

Here are some tasks that can be implemented in the future to enhance the app:

1.**Redis for Caching and Replication**
I am considering implementing Redis, a powerful in-memory data store, to optimize performance through caching and replication strategies. Redis can significantly speed up data retrieval by storing frequently accessed data in memory. Additionally, Redis's replication capabilities can improve fault tolerance and data availability.

[ ] Conduct user analysis to formulate a caching and replication strategy.

2. **Enhanced Reports**:
   To provide a richer user experience and gather more valuable insights, we're working on enhancing the reports generated by the app. This includes gathering more detailed data about URL availability and response times, as well as improving the overall quality of the generated reports.

[ ] Enhance reports to gather richer data and improve their overall quality.

3. **Multithreading for URL Monitoring**:
   Currently, the app monitors URLs sequentially. This means that if a URL takes a long time to respond, the app will wait for it to respond before moving on to the next URL. This can be improved by implementing multithreading, which will allow the app to monitor multiple URLs simultaneously.

[ ] Consider implementing multithreading for URL monitoring refactoring.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   The app currently has a few basic tests to ensure its functionality. However, more comprehensive testing can be implemented to ensure that the app is working as intended.

[ ] Develop more comprehensive testing to ensure the system's overall functionality.

## Feedback

I appreciate your feedback and suggestions for improving this app. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for enhancements, please open an issue on this repository.
