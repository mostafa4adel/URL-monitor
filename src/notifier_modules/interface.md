# Notifier Interface

The `Notifier` is an interface-like structure that defines a contract for objects that send notifications. When creating a notifier, it's essential to abide by the settings and methods defined by the `Notifier` interface.

## Notifier Interface Contract

The `Notifier` interface expects derived classes to adhere to the following:

### `sendNotification()`

The `sendNotification` method must be implemented by classes that extend the `Notifier` interface. This method is responsible for sending the notification.

```javascript
class EmailNotifier extends Notifier {
  // Implement the required sendNotification method
  sendNotification() {
    // Implement notification sending logic here
    // ...
  }
}
```

### `settings`
